The proposed technique only requires the camera to observe a planar pattern shown at a few (at
least two) different orientations. The pattern can be printed on a laser printer and attached to a "rea-
sonable" planar surface (e.g., a hard book cover). Either the camera or the planar pattern can be moved
by hand. The motion need not be known. The proposed approach lies between the photogrammet-
ric calibration and self-calibration, because we use 2D metric information rather than 3D or purely
implicit one. Both computer simulation and real data have been used to test the proposed technique,
and very good results have been obtained. Compared with classical techniques. the proposed tech-
nique is considerably mon flexible. Compared with self-calibration, it gains considerable degree of
robustness. We believe the new technique advances 3D computer vision one step from laboratory
environments to the real world.
Note that Bill Triggs [22] recently developed a self-calibration technique from at least 5 views of
a planar scene. His technique is more flexible than ours, but has difficulty to initialize. Liebowitz and
Zisserman [14] described a technique of metric rectification for perspective images of planes using
